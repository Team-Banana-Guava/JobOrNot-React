                Create an account then start a talent search. Make a resume 
                collection by providing the job title, company, and skills 
                required for the position. Go to the resume viewer and quickly
                move resumes into the collection, click right for job, left 
                for not. The profile page keeps a library of collections and 
                is the entry point for a new talent search.

                Simply sign up and upload a one page resume in pdf format 
                to the profile along with a short list of marketable skills 
                that match the resume. Recruiters will then search for resumes 
                based on skill sets. Back on the profile page, track the 
                number of resume views and make any updates to the account.
